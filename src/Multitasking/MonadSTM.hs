-- | 'MonadSTM' is a class for all monads which can do 'STM' actions.
--
-- Keep in mind that while some monads (e.g. 'IO') can do 'STM', your 'STM' actions may not
-- be executed 'atomically' if you run them all in the 'IO' monad. Keep them together in 'STM' and
-- then use one 'liftSTM' to lift them to the 'IO' monad.

  -- | Lift 'STM' into the monad `m`.

  -- Keep in mind that 'liftSTM' may lose atomicity. `liftSTM action1 >> liftSTM action2` might not be atomic, depending on the monad `m`. Use `liftSTM (action1 >> action2)` instead.

  -- | Lift an action which can be done in 'STM' or in 'IO'.
  -- This can be useful if the 'IO' version is more performant.
